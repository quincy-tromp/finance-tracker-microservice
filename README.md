# finance-tracker-microservice

## Project Overview

The Finance Tracker Microservice is a RESTful API built using .NET to enable users to manage their personal finances through a secure, scalable, and feature-rich platform. This project is designed to support my transition from a junior to a medior developer by focusing on complex REST API development, microservices architecture, and modern software engineering practices.
